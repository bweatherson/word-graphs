Mostly the data comes from JSTOR. But for the _Australasian Journal of Philosophy_ and the most recent issues of journals that are not yet on JSTOR, I downloaded the papers directly and used [pdftools](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pdftools/index.html) to extract the text.

I haven't included all of the words here, because it would take up too much server space. The words you can search for are

1. At least three letters long;
2. Appear at least 2000 times across the 20 journals over 40 years; and
3. Appear at least 10 times in at least 1 article.
